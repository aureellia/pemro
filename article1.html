    <p>Machine learning is a fascinating field that has seen rapid growth in recent years. It is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. In this article, we'll explore the basics of machine learning, including its definition, types, and applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Definition of Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is the process of training a computer system to learn from data and improve its performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It relies on algorithms that can analyze and interpret patterns in data, allowing the system to make predictions or decisions based on new data.</p>
    
    <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>There are several types of machine learning, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is associated with a corresponding output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Unsupervised learning involves training the algorithm on an unlabeled dataset and allowing it to find patterns or structures in the data on its own.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Reinforcement learning is a type of learning where the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Applications of Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>Machine learning has a wide range of applications across various industries, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical data and assist in diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug discovery.</li>
        <li><strong>Finance:</strong> In finance, machine learning is used for fraud detection, risk assessment, and algorithmic trading.</li>
        <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> E-commerce companies use machine learning to personalize recommendations, optimize pricing, and improve customer experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Machine learning is used in transportation for route optimization, traffic prediction, and autonomous vehicles.</li>
    </ul>
